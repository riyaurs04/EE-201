###### Welcome to my personal page!

### **About Me**
I'm a second year electrical and computer engineering student here at the University of Washington in Seattle. I was born and raised in the Bay Area, specifically in Cupertino (home of Apple campus). My current interests are in AI and ML.

### **Hobbies**
- I am a huge basketball fan. I first started playing basketball back in 5th grade and played on my high school varsity team. Since I'm from the Bay Area, I am also a huge Golden State Warriors fan.
- I love listening to music. My favorite genre is pop, but I also enjoy listening to R&B, Hip-Hop, and Lofi. My favorite artist would have to be Enhypen.
- I really enjoy playing the cello. I don't play as often as I used to, but I still like to play music from time to time when I get the chance.

## **Internship Experiences**
- During the summer before my senior year in high school, I interned at SRITA (Stanford Research in Tobacco Advertising) and helped research how big scale tobacco companies target next-generation tobacco users. Although my current career path did not necessarily correlate to this internship, I was able to gain a newfound love for research.
- This past summer, I interned at Stanford's radiology department to develop labeling guides being used to train ML models. It was really interesting to work on developing guides that were to be used for ML models, especially since I'm interested in learning how to implement the backend of AI and ML.
